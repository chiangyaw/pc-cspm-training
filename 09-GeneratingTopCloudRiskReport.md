## Generating Top Cloud Risk & Incident Report
Another way to look into the top cloud risk & incident is to look into the Command Center Dashboard. The Command Center dashboard provides you with a unified view of the top cloud security incidents and risks uncovered across the assets monitored by Prisma Cloud. It provides security teams with an at a glance picture of the highest priority incidents and risks that require attention across the different attack vectors, such as Incidents, Attack Paths, Misconfigurations, Vulnerabilities, Exposures, Identity Risks and Data Risks. You can also generate a Top Cloud Risk & Incident Report via Command Center Dashboard as well.

In this section, we will provide a step by step guide on reviewing top incidents on Command Center Dashboard, and generating Top Cloud Risk & Incident Report. 

1. Go to Cloud Security > Dashboards > Command Center.
