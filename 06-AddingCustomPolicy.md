# Prisma Cloud Hands on Lab - Secure The Infrastructure
## Adding Custom Policy to an Alert Rule
In order for a policy to generate alert, it has to be added to an alert rule. Users can create an alert rule that associates all of the cloud accounts in an account group with the set of policies for which you want Prisma Cloud to generate alerts. You can view the alerts for all of your cloud environments directly from Prisma Cloud and drill down in to each to view specific policy violations. You can also send these alert notifications to a third party tools, such as e-mail, ticketing systems and more. In this section, we will cover a step by step guide on creating the alert rule, associating it with your account group, and enable e-mail notification.

1. Click on Alert > View Alert Rules. Click on Add Alert Rule on the pop up window.

6. Run through the Summary page, and click Save. 

_Note: We are using Emails as a notification in this example. Email is not the best approach from notification perspective as there is usually delay when a notification is triggered, which can be due to email security installed in the customerâ€™s email account/server. For actual deployment, typical notifications can be AWS Security Hub, SNS, etc._
